- starts off in the house
- the screen shakes signifying something is happening outside
- the hero goes outside and sees monsters destroying the town
- then the tutorial happens where the hero has to defend the houses from the waves of monsters
- after the waves, the hero can talk to the npc's and find out more about the story
- one of the npc's tell him about the sacrifices and how his wife/gf has been taken
- next he goes into the portal and moves on to the next level
- while going through the portal, there's a cutscene where the ghost is flying around and chasing the hero
- the ghost chases the hero through the level and the hero also encounters monsters along the way
- the monsters are only at the purified areas where the ghost cant touch the hero
- the hero must kill the monsters so he can use these areas as safe areas
- eventually the hero must get to the main safe area where there is a puzzle
- after the puzzle the hero must fight the ghost
- the hero will get a big peice of plasma from the ghost when it is defeated
